# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)

1. Probably to let the student's experiment and add features.
   (As long as the layout is similar)
2. Have a couple of silly images in the "images" directory to give the a choice of backgrounds.
   (Makes it a bit more interactive to have choices)
3. And make them add a fixed link to scroll up for them since the page is a bit long.
4. Maybe as a "bonus" let us add a background song. With very few instructions. (Optional^\_^)
